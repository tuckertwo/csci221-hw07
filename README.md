# General Information
This is, more or less, the same library as implemented in Homework #6,
but implemented using classes instead of structs.
It was written by Tucker R. Twomey and Julian Jacklin.

# Compiling and Testing
The compilation process for this library is fairly standard;
just generate a Makefile using `cmake` or `ccmake` and proceed
from there.
```
$ ccmake .
$ make -j4 # if your machine has 4 CPU cores
$ ./test_tree
```
